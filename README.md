# ANANSI
ANANSI is a simple Case Management System based on Metadata. It aims to be lightweight, easy to learn, great for searching, extendable, secure and auditable. It is web-based and will integrate into most internal offline networks with minimal configuration.

## Why?
I have experience of working with bloated and inferior case management and similar systems that are not fit for purpose. I am very familiar with the needs of modern environments including the need to rapidly change and adapt to new legislation, security and audit requirements while focussing on the importance of streamlining and automating as much of the workflow as possible.

## What about Lima? Nimbus? Spreadsheets?
The commercial solutions are expensive, and do not provide a good fit for many organisations without extensive integration systems and custom development. Few operational units have the time, funds, or expertise to make this work effectively. Spreadsheets can be effective for small units, but have issues with multi-user access, versioning, auditing etc. Achieving accreditation may also be challenging.

## Who develops ANANSI?
This is my project, developed in my own time, albeit using experience and knowledge gained while working with other Case Management Systems. Having spent huge amounts of time attempting to reduce the impact of flaws in commercial systems, and introduce automation, I have come to a point where further work on these systems is futile and a new system will be more impactive.

## What about accreditation?
Anyone involved in accreditation will know this is a long and arduous process. However, this system aims to work around existing policies and not (like other systems) force you to change your policies to work around the system. That being said, some changes will be necessary, although the outcome will be worthwhile!

## Why is it called ANANSI?
A previous project was named after a beloved well-known character, but a different name was required. Anansi is a cunning spider from West African folklore, known for outwitting larger animals.

## Where is the code?
The code is currently closed-source while development is ongoing. It will be released in due course.
